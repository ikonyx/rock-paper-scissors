# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This TOP(The Oden Project) project helped me get more familiar with:
- JavaScript
- Manipulating the DOM
- Git branching

The project consists of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game's logic with JS, designing a UI, displaying the running score, and announcing a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
